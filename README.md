# Hey, I'm Saban Kara!

I focus on solutions, not problems, with an inquiring, questioning and productive mindset. I use my talents, skills and dreams to take my business to the next level. **Machine learning** is one of my biggest dreams, working in this field gives me pleasure, I am trying to discover my talents and improve my skills, I am happy to work with **machine learning**, I work with pleasure. As I study, I see that there are things I don't know, but that doesn't scare me!


Note: Mithrandir means Gandalf in Elvish. Gray Gandalf/Mithrandir disappeared in his deadly battle with Balrog and he came back as White.
