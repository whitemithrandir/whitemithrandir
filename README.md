# Hey, I'm Saban Kara!

I focus on solutions, not problems, with an inquiring, questioning and productive mindset. I use my talents, skills and dreams to take my business to the next level. Machine learning is one of my biggest dreams, it gives me pleasure to work in this field, I try to discover my talents and improve my skills, I am happy to work with machine learning, I work with pleasure. While reading, I see that there are things I don't know, but that doesn't scare me!

Many service tools are used in **machine learning**; I'm working on **tensorflow** developed by **Google**, I'm on the way to specialize in **Natural Language Processing** and **Time Series**
